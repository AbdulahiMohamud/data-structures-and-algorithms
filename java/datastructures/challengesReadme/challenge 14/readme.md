# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create Tree Methods

Traversal Methods: preOrderTraversal inOrderTraversal postOrderTraversal

Binary Search methods: depthFirstSearch breadthFirstSearch

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
pre order
in order
post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
Binary Search Tree
Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
Add
Arguments: value
Return: nothing
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Contains
Argument: value
Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Took the recursive approach for each method traversals.

Big O notation: Time Complexity O(n) and Auxillary Space complexity O(n).
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
preOrder(); inOrder(); postOrder();

add(); contains();
