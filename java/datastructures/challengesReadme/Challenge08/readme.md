# Challenge Summary

Write a function called zip lists
Arguments: 2 linked lists
Return: New Linked List, zipped as noted below
Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.
Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.


## WhiteBoard

![Whiteboard](img/Linked-List-Whiteboarding.jpg)

used visuals to loop to do a step through to understand what needs to be done with every iteration



## Approach & Efficiency
we used three placeholder values to help reassign the references in the link list.
For the time and space we are both O(1) we are not adding anything and using the same space given to us.
